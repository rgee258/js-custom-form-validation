# Custom Form Validation

This repository contains a simple HTML form that has been given a touchup with some custom validation using JS.

Check it out [here](https://rgee258.github.io/js-custom-form-validation/).

This project is done following The Odin Project, which can
be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/forms-javascript).

## Usage

The custom form checks for proper inputs and removes the error denoted red styling whenever a form input is properly filled out. Customized error messages will occur when an improper input value exists or the form is submitted with improper input fields.
